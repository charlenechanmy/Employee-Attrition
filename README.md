# Employee Attrition at IBM

## Project Description
Employee turnover is inevitable. However, there are
extremely high costs associated with high employee
turnover rates. Disengaged employees also cost a
company a bomb!

The current attrition related problem in IBM is currently at a high 16% attrition rate and our goal is to reduce it to 10%.

## Objective
1. Identify important factors influencing attrition
2. Build a model to
predict likelihood
of attrition
3. Make
profit-maximising
recommendations
to reduce attrition
